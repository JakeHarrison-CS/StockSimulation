# StockSimulation

The StockBacktester is a Java-based project designed to provide users with a simulated environment to practice buying and selling stocks while also offering the functionality to analyze stock performance using moving averages. The project was built over the span of 4 weeks as a final project for my grade 11 Computer Science class.
To use: run the mainMenu.java located in src/GUI/mainMenu.java

Key Features:

    1. Stock Market Simulation: The project allows users to buy and sell stock, enabling them to simulate buying and selling stocks without actually investing real money. Users can monitor the performance of their portfolio, view current stock prices, and see a live graph.

    2. Historical Data: The simulator is run off of the historical market data from some of the top stocks on the Nasdaq.

    3. Graphing: The user can launch a chart displaying the "real-time" stock data and an optional moving average (of which the user can select the amount of time).

    4. Moving Average Analysis: The simulator includes a powerful moving average analysis tool that assists users in identifying trends and making informed decisions. Users can pick a stock and starting money and see how much money would have been made if you bought and sold based of the moving average from 1 day to 500.

    5. User-Friendly Interface: The project features an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to navigate through the different functionalities. The interface provides clear visualizations, interactive charts, and customizable settings to enhance the user experience.

Overall, this project was fun and challenging to code, and we learned a lot from coding it including: file management, UI building, adding libraries to projects, RAM management, APIs, managing threads, and most importantly, teamwork.

Some known bugs include:

    1. Sometime when you click on a button it doesn't activate. To our knowlege this isn't anything we can fix.
    2. When clicking on a text box and entering, the number doesn't save until you click out. Once again we couldn't find a solution online and this isn't out fault.
